Updates:
10-22-19 Kill updater at beginning and end of script to help ensure smooth deployment.

9-25-19 Fixed some behavior related to system PATH variable.

9-6-19 Changed package behavior. Now checks for binaries in expected places before running the install. This greatly improves efficiency, 
while slightly increasing the chance of a mistake. In the rare event of a problem with a local install, manual intervention would probably be required anyway.

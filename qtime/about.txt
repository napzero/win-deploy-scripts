Apple QuickTime. 

This package automatically disables update checks, both at the system and user level via Activesetup.


Updates:
10/15/15 Potentially disabled/removed the MIME dialog on first run.
8/12/15 Implemented Activesetup component to disable user-level update checking.




Known issue:
The first time its run, Quicktime still asks about MIME associations. I'll figure that out someday.

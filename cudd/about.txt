Copy/import User profiles from Drive to Drive. Run from booted target drive.


Notes:
This script is designed to import user profiles from a secondary Windows drive.
It copies the profile and imports the profile keys from the offline registry hives.

DO NOT transfer user profiles between very different Windows versions,
like Win7 to 8, 8 to 8.1, 8.1 to 10, or Windows 10 1507 to 1607 (1607+ are ok at this time),
because this will break things like the Start menu, and you will need to rebuild the profile anyway.



Suggested procedure:
Ensure old drive is ready for migration (Adobe and other licensed software uninstalled/deactivated).
Shut down.
Disconnect old drive, connect new drive.
Image new drive.
Shut down.
Reconnect old drive but boot to new drive.
Run this script, selecting the old drive.
Wait for script to finish work.
Shut down, remove old drive.
Label old drive with date, original hostname, and note for later erasure. Store in a secured drawer.
